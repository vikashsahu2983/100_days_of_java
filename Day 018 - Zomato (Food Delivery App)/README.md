Day 018 - Program - Zomato (Food Delivery App)
______________________________________________________________

Scenario: Zomato wants to track how many total orders are placed across the entire 
app. Each restaurant can only record its last order (since we arenâ€™t using arrays).
Create a class Restaurant with:
An instance variable restaurantName.
An instance variable lastOrderedItem.
A static variable totalOrders.
A method placeOrder(String itemName, int quantity) that sets lastOrderedItem and 
increases totalOrders.
Question: Show how ordering food from different restaurants updates totalOrders.
