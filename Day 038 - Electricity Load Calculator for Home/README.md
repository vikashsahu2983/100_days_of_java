Day 038 – Electricity Load Calculator for Home

Problem Statement: A homeowner wants to estimate the total electrical load of their house before applying for a new electricity connection. Write a program that asks the user for the number of different electrical appliances they use and the wattage of each appliance. Based on this, calculate the total connected load in watts and then convert it into kilowatts (kW). Finally, determine whether the total load falls under the Domestic Low Load Category (up to 5 kW) or High Load Category (above 5 kW).

Calculate the total load in watts.

Convert the total load to kW.

Print the category of load based on the calculated kW.

Sample Input 1: Enter number of appliances: 3 Enter wattage of appliance 1: 60 Enter wattage of appliance 2: 120 Enter wattage of appliance 3: 200

Sample Output 1: Total Load: 380 watts Total Load in kW: 0.38 kW Category: Domestic Low Load

Sample Input 2: Enter number of appliances: 4 Enter wattage of appliance 1: 900 Enter wattage of appliance 2: 1500 Enter wattage of appliance 3: 500 Enter wattage of appliance 4: 3000

Sample Output 2: Total Load: 5900 watts Total Load in kW: 5.9 kW Category: High L
