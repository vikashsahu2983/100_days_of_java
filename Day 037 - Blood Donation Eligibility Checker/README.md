Problem Statement:
Write a Java program that helps determine whether a person is eligible to donate blood or not. The program should ask the user for their name, age, weight, and whether they have any recent medical issues.
Based on the inputs, the program must decide eligibility using the following rules:

The person's age must be between 18 and 65.

The person's weight must be 50 kg or above.

The person should not have any major medical issues such as recent surgery, infection, or chronic illness.

If all conditions are met, the person is eligible to donate blood.

Otherwise, display the reason why the person is not eligible.

The program should display a clear and friendly message showing the final result.
